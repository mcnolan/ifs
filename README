This edition of IFS was altered from the 1.12 release, to correct several inherent flaws in the install. In addition, i've made several key changes to what is installed to the system by default and tweaked the default theme a little to give you a head start on getting this thing to look the way you want.

All subsequent work on IFS was done without the support, knowledge or approval of Frank Anon, the orginal Designer (Couldn't contact for comment). I keep an eye on the IFS forums at the Obsidian Fleet Forums and will respond to any support requests for this version there.

Good Luck,
Nolan

UPDATED: March 2014
I have applied various fixes in an attempt to get IFS running on php 5.5+. Note this software is now 10 years old (the mambo backend is from 2001!), The administration area no longer works and who knows what else. Due to the possibly considerable amount of work required to update the mambo components, this will be the final patch I issue for IFS.
