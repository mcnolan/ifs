OBSIDIAN FLEET INTEGRATED FLEET SYSTEM

VERSION 1.13n
RELEASE December 2009

So, you've decided to give IFS a go, eh?  Well, I hope you like it!

Installing IFS is a relatively painless process, or so I hope.  Making it look
and act they way you want... well... that's a different story.  =p

Here's a list of what documentation is included:

INSTALL.txt - step-by-step installation instructions
THEMES.txt - an explanation of the skinning system, and how to create your own
			 theme for IFS.  Trust me, once you see the default theme, this will
             be the first thing you look at!
FAQ.txt - some general, miscellaneous questions and comments.
LICENSE and GPL.txt - do I need to explain?

If you have an issue that isn't explained in the documentation, you can try
asking in the IFS forum - http://www.obsidianfleet.net/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=41
If it's a bug, http://www.obsidianfleet.net/ifs/ is the place to go - follow the
link to the bug reporting page (thanks to SourceForge).

Lastly, a favour that I ask: if you are successful in installing and running
IFS, please check the IFS Forum once in a while and help anyone that needs a
hand in setting it up.  I don't have time to respond to every request, and this
would help me a lot.  http://www.obsidianfleet.net/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=41

Addendum, December 2009.

This edition of IFS was altered from the 1.12 release, to correct several inherent flaws in the install. In addition, i've made several key changes to what is installed to the system by default and tweaked the default theme a little to give you a head start on getting this thing to look the way you want.

All subsequent work on IFS was done without the support, knowledge or approval of Frank Anon, the orginal Designer (Couldn't contact for comment). I keep an eye on the IFS forums at the Obsidian Fleet Forums and will respond to any support requests for this version there.

Good Luck,
Nolan
