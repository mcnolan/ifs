OBSIDIAN FLEET INTEGRATED FLEET SYSTEM

VERSION 1.13n
RELEASE December 2009

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---


As of version 1.13n, there are 2 options for installing IFS.


Option 1 : Browser install
1 - CHMOD configuration.php to 0777. This will allow the installer to write to your config file.

2 - In your web browser, open install.php and enter your details as instructed. This script will write a configuration file for you and install the database.

Option 2 : Manual Install

1 - Open configuration.php and enter, at the very least, your mySQL server,user, password, and database.
    You'll probably also want to change the email settings, fleet name, and URL.

2 - Run the file manual_install.php.  This will set up your mySQL databases. 


After Installing

3 - Now you've got some CHMOD'ing to do.  The following files/folders need to
	be world-writable (0777):
    	errorlog
        images/stories/	  (if you want to be able to use Mambo's upload feature)
	change configuration.php to 0755 if you used install option 1

4 - Change the default login.  admin/admin will give you full administrator access, but don't leave it at that.  Unless you want to give the world admin access...

5 - The base installation of IFS is done!  There is, of course, a lot of
	customizing that I'll bet you want to do... but that's for another time.

If you have any problems or questions, drop by the IFS Forums at
http://www.obsidianfleet.net/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=41 and leave a post.  Also,
as a favour that I ask of people who have successfully installed and used IFS,
please check the forums once in a while and help answer questions; I receive too
many help requests, and I could use a hand in responding to them all! =)

Addendum, December 2009

Should Option 1 not work for you, give Option 2 a try. If both do not succeed for some reason, please don't hesitate to use the forum mentioned by Frank. I keep an eye on it, and will provide assistance to those who need it.

Good Luck,
Nolan
