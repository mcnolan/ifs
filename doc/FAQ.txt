How do I add... menu items / news stories / articles / FAQs / web links /
newsflashes / banners
	Go into Mambo Admin (Triad menu) and play around in there.

How do I add Task Forces / Task Groups?
	FCOps Tools

How do I add ships?
	TFCO tools

How do I add characters?
	CO Menu -> Update Manifest

How do I add / remove ranks from the listing?  Why are the rank images broken?
	Ranks are listed in the {spre}_rank table.  Images are broken since we don't
    have a set of pips to distribute... see the bug tracking page for details.

Why aren't ship banners displaying?
	IFS assumes that ship banners are in images/ships/ and will automatically
    tack that on to the image field.  So, if you enter "ship.jpg" in the image
    field, the banner should be at images/ships/ship.jpg

Why aren't TF/TG banners displaying on the Ship Listing?
	IFS assumes banner locations and names using the following convention:
   	Task Force banner at images/tfbanners/tf(tf number).jpg
    Task Group banner at images/tfbanners/tg(tf number)-(tg number).jpg

Where's the link to the ship listing?
	Create your own link - index.php?option=ships
    And you can specify TF/TG... ie index.php?option=ships&tf=1&tg=1
    (and even better to use &amp; instead of plain & for XHTML compliance)

What about the link to the ship DB?
	Create your own link again - index.php?option=shipdb

Why are there more goodies on the OFHQ site?  Why aren't they in the release?
	This is a fully-functional public release of IFS; however I never said that
    everything on OFHQ would be released, nor am I under any obligation to
    do so.  You've got almost all of the core features of IFS, though.
    UPDATE (05/11/04): I've included just about everything in the 1.1 release;
    				   it's a lot easier for me to keep OFHQ sync'ed with the
                       public release this way.

Isn't that against the GPL?  Don't you have to release everything?
	Nope.  The GPL governs *how* you release stuff, not *whether* you release
    it.  See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html if you don't believe me.

How do I change the default positions on a ship?
	tf/positions.txt

How do I change the possible status descriptions for a ship?
	tf/status.txt

Wouldn't it make more sense to put those in a SQL table?
	Yes.

Why is everything empty?  There's nothing in the shipdb, task forces, etc, etc.
	This is for *your* fleet.  Get your own info! =)

How do I add/remove a menu item on the CO, TFCO, etc, menu?
	There's no utility for it at the moment.  Go directly into the mySQL table
    {mpre}menu; the "menutype" field indicates which menu; the "name", "link",
    and "inuse" fields are self-explanatory.  The other fields are not used.

How do I add/remove/rename a userlevel?
	Again, you need to go directly to the database for that. In the {spre}flags
    table, you can change the "name" field.  The letter flag is hard-coded into
    the IFS pages and referenced in the user table, so I'd suggest that you
    don't change those unless you understand the code.

How do I use images for menu items instead of text links?
	If you use <img src> HTML tags as the name of the menu items, I *think* it
    should work.  But I've never tried it.

You mention XHTML earlier.  Is IFS XML-compliant?
	Not yet; that's one of my goals.

When is the next version coming out?
	Have you seen my to-do list?  Both the RPG and the real-life versions?

What will be in upcoming versions?
	See http://www.obsidianfleet.net/ifs/ and
    http://www.obsidianfleet.net/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=41; I'll be putting up
    an "Upcoming Features" page soon (if it's not already up).

Why isn't my question answered here?
	I can't read minds.  Post questions on the IFS Developers Forums at
    http://www.obsidianfleet.net/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=41 and maybe it'll make
    it to the next version's FAQ.  Or, post a Tracker item on our SourceForge
    page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ifs/).
